Role Name
=========

[![build](https://github.com/geoffreyvanwyk/ansible-role-moodle/workflows/Build/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/geoffreyvanwyk/ansible-role-moodle/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)

A brief description of the role goes here.

Requirements
------------

> Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role
> should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may
> be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

...

Role Variables
--------------

> A description of the settable variables for this role should go here,
> including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any
> variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that
> are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars,
> etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

...

Dependencies
------------

> A list of other roles hosted on Galaxy should go here, plus any details in
> regards to parameters that may need to be set for other roles, or variables that
> are used from other roles.

...

Example Playbook
----------------

> Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables
> passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```ansible
- hosts: servers
  roles:
    - role: geoffreyvanwyk.moodle
      x: 42
```
